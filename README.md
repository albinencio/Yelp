# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] App icon.
- [x] Tab bar styling with personalized icons.
- [x] Navigation bar styling.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to let the user pick a default category of restaurants that will first show up when opening the app. 
2. How to implement loadMoreData() when doing infinite scroll.
3. How to implement map view of restaurant results.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

The biggest challenge was understanding how MapKit works, and also understanding how to load more data when implementing infinite scroll.
